Having two deflectors allowed for one to be used while the other was being refurbished after a previous launch. Each deflector measured 39 feet (12 m) high by 49 feet (15 m) wide by 75 feet (23 m) long, and weighed 1,400,000 pounds (635 t). During a launch, it deflected the launch vehicle's rocket exhaust flame into a trench measuring 43 feet (13 m) deep by 59 feet (18 m) wide by 449 feet (137 m) long.\n\n>Sound Suppression Water System - \nA Sound Suppression Water System (SSWS) was added to protect the Space Shuttle and its payload from effects of the intense sound wave pressure generated by its engines. An elevated water tank on a 290-foot (88 m) tower near each pad stored 300,000 U.S. gallons (1,100,000 liters) of water, which was released onto the mobile launcher platform just before engine ignition.[31] The water muffled the intense sound waves produced by the engines. Due to heating of the water, a large quantity of steam and water vapor was produced during launch."

                    "text": "I fully believe the most sustainable, most economically efficient, most potentially decentralised, most diverse future of protein is single cellular fermentation. Precision fermentation of bacteria.\n\nAt the moment plants are by far the most efficient source of protein (yes, all essential amino acids). But there is a bottleneck in production efficiency in protein from plants, insects, and animals. Photosynthesis.\n\nAll currently feasible protein production requires plant matter. Either plant based substrate to feed to non insect animals to eat them (highly inefficient), plant based substrate to feed to insects (less inefficient than non insect animals), or plant based material to eat directly. All of it relies on the relatively inefficient process of plants converting energy from the sun into chemical energy to create protein.\n\nBut we have the potential to synthesise substrates using much more efficient solar energy conversion for use with microbial synthesis of protein. \n\nIt would also come with the following benefits:\n\nHigh protein yield: Microbes can be grown to produce high concentrations of protein, typically 30-80% of their dry weight. This is much higher than the protein content of plant or animal-based foods.\n\nFast growth rates: Microbes can grow very quickly, with some species doubling their cell mass every 20-30 minutes. This means that large amounts of protein can be produced in a short period of time.\n\nScalability: Monocellular fermentation can be scaled up to produce large quantities of protein. This makes it a potentially viable method for meeting global demand for protein.\n\nVersatility: Microbes can be grown on a variety of substrates, including food waste, agricultural byproducts, and even carbon dioxide. This makes monocellular fermentation a sustainable method for producing protein.\n\nSafety: Microbes can be genetically engineered to produce proteins with specific properties, such as increased nutritional value or resistance to disease. This can help to ensure the safety of monocellular fermentation-produced protein.\n\nOverall, monocellular fermentation is arguably the most promising method for producing protein in a sustainable and efficient way. But until we see mature methods for producing food this way, I am sticking to to the most practically efficient way to create food and protein. Plants."

Louisiana, Chevron and the American Petroleum Institute argued that the alteration violates the provision in the Inflation Reduction Act that mandates the leases be sold in September.\n\n....\n\n>The curtailment of the leasing acreage was part of a settlement agreement to protect the Gulf\u2019s Rice\u2019s whale population. Only about 50 of the whales remain in the Gulf, and about 20 percent of the whales were killed by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. \n\n>In addition to reducing the size of the lease area, under the settlement agreement, the BOEM will require any purchasers of oil and gas leases in the whales\u2019 habitat to take steps to reduce threats to them, including making sure industry ships travel through those areas at no faster than 10 knots.  \n\narticle continues....."

Hence, the \"forever\" part.\n\nHumans are mainly exposed to PFAS through food and drinking water. In addition, many food packaging materials and plastic bags can also contain PFAS, which can be transferred to the food we eat. With a 2021 US study finding that PFAS was present in plant-based drinking straws, researchers from the University of Antwerp in Belgium analyzed straws made of various materials to see if the same was true in Europe.\n\nThe researchers [tested](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2023.2240908) 39 different brands of straws made from paper, glass, bamboo, stainless steel, and plastic, and analyzed them for 29 different PFAS compounds.\n\nThe majority of brands tested (69%) contained PFAS, with 18 different PFAS detected in total. Paper straws were most likely to contain PFAS, with the chemicals detected in 90% of the brands tested, albeit in highly variable concentrations. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a compound linked to high cholesterol, a reduced immune response, thyroid disease and increased kidney and testicular cancer, was most frequently detected. PFOA has been banned globally since 2020. Also detected were trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS), ultra-short-chain PFAS that are highly water-soluble and so might leach out of straws into drinks.\n\nBamboo straws fared only slightly better than paper ones, with PFAS found in 80% of brands tested. The chemicals were found in 75% of plastic straws and 40% of glass brands. PFAS were not detected in any of the steel straws tested."

But minds can be changed over time.\u201d\n\nand if you\u2019d like to [read more](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-08-24/how-south-koreans-composting-system-became-a-model-for-the-world) but hit the paywall, you can register your email with us and read without a subscription."

The bill is currently being considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\nHere are some specific provisions of the PEER Act:\r  \n\r  \nThe bill would authorize $45 million annually for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fund scholarships, fellowships, and research at institutions of higher education relevant to the federal permitting process.\r  \nThe bill would direct agencies to conduct human capital planning for their environmental review workforce and provide additional hiring authority to facilitate the recruitment and hiring of environmental review staff.\r  \nThe bill would allow an agency to fund liaison positions at other federal agencies, or at state, local or tribal agencies to facilitate timely completion of the environmental review process for a project or program.\r  \nThe bill would allow states to use a portion of federal highway dollars for the operational expenses related to the use of highway rights-of-way for high voltage transmission lines.\r  \nThe bill would make reforms through amendments to the Federal Power Act and directives to amend Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulations to allow the United States to proactively plan and build the broad regional grid it needs.\r  \nThe PEER Act is a complex piece of legislation with a number of potential impacts. It is still being considered by Congress, and it is not yet clear whether it will be passed into law. However, the bill has the potential to make significant changes to the federal environmental review and permitting process, with the goal of accelerating the approval of clean energy projects and other infrastructure projects while also protecting the environment and public health."

Climate, water, ecological sytems are buffered and can accept insults to a point which evidence suggests we have well passed. The paradox is that we have been unable to mobilize the world to avoid life threatening impacts how do we mobilize support for actions that will only yield tangible results generations into the future.  Great societies of the past have collapsed due to regional misuse of resources. We may be at the pecipice of a world-wide human collapse. Everyone needs to what they can but without bold collective actions the future is certain."

                    "text": "**From  Sarah Kaplan, Bonnie Jo Mount, Simon Ducroquet, Emily Wright and Frank Hulley-Jones:**\r  \nGreenland had not been kind to Joerg Schaefer. For 21 days, he had endured howling winds and blistering cold. He sampled ice until his fingers went numb and shoveled snow until his shoulders burned. His shelter was a cramped yellow tent, his bathroom a hole in the ground.\r  \n\r  \nAnd the experiment that brought him to this ruthless, frozen expanse \u2013 an unprecedented effort to drill through more than 1,600 feet of ice and uncover the bedrock below \u2013 was teetering on the brink of failure.\r  \n\r  \nA thin, dark fracture had appeared deep in the ice, making it impossible to drill. The team\u2019s engineers were trying to repair the hole, but it was far from clear whether the fix would work. Schaefer\u2019s hopes \u2014 and research that could help predict the fate of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet and its contribution to rising seas \u2014 clung to the smallest possible chance that the team might still find what they came for.\r  \n\r  \nNow, Schaefer would have to leave with his mission unfinished. A family emergency had called him home to New York, and a helicopter was waiting to take him back to civilization.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe timing feels completely wrong,\u201d said Schaefer, a climate geochemist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the lead investigator for the project known as GreenDrill. \u201cWe have been working toward getting that bedrock for literally years. \u2026 It\u2019s pretty heartbreaking now to leave.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe drilling expedition this spring was only the third time in history that researchers had tried to extract rock from deep beneath Greenland\u2019s ice. Scientists have less material from under the ice sheet than they do from the surface of the moon. But Schaefer believes the uncharted landscape is key to understanding Greenland\u2019s past \u2013 and to forecasting the future of the warming Earth.\r  \n\r  \nThe Greenland Ice Sheet contributes more to rising oceans than any other ice mass on the planet. If it all disappeared, it would raise global sea levels by 24 feet, devastating coastlines that are home to about half the world\u2019s population. Yet computer simulations and modern observations alone can\u2019t precisely predict how Greenland might melt. Researchers are still unsure whether rising temperatures have already pushed the ice sheet into irreversible decline.\r  \n\r  \nGreenland\u2019s bedrock holds the ground truth, Schaefer said. The ancient stone that underlies the island is solid, persistent and almost unmovable. It was present the last time the ice sheet completely disappeared, and it still contains chemical signatures of how that melt unfolded. It can help scientists figure out how drastically Greenland may change in the face of today\u2019s rising temperatures. And that, in turn, can help the world prepare for the sea level rise that will follow.\r  \n\r  \n**Read more about the Greenland ice sheet here, and skip the paywall with email registration:** [**https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/greenland-ice-sheet-drilling-bedrock-sea-rise/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/greenland-ice-sheet-drilling-bedrock-sea-rise/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)"

That is equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education. Countries have pledged to phase out subsidies for years to ensure the price of fossil fuels reflects their true environmental costs, but have achieved little to date.\n\nExplicit subsidies, which cut the price of fuels for consumers, doubled in 2022 as countries responded to the higher energy prices resulting from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Rich households benefited far more from these than poor ones, the IMF said. Implicit subsidies, which represent the \u201cenormous\u201d costs of the damage caused by fossil fuels through climate change and air pollution, made up 80% of the total."

I believe it\u2019s possible now.\n\nMy thoughts are along the lines of flooding, and how lighting can be DC due to the massively lower amount of power required to light living areas. \n\nIf you\u2019re designing for flooding, and trying to maximise the amount of copper wire available for evehicles, like ebikes or escooters, having no 110/240 volts at all is a great improvement, and I think makes sense.\n\nAlso high mobility does enable more battery operated lighting. You aren\u2019t tied to having the lights in a specific place, or furniture etc.\n\nMore - it\u2019s actually getting to the point where heat recovery devices and filters may be the more suitable option for hot water used for washing. Showers and the like are likely going low flow, and water cost, restrictions and drought and rainfall mean heat recovery from warm or hot water can make water heating requirements far less energy consuming. \n\nAnd for cooking, it\u2019s actually possible to defrost or bring refrigerated foods to room temperature reducing how much energy is needed to warm or cook. High efficiency DC microwaves to heat food, and where things are fried, induction fry pans help reduce energy by the far more precise heat locating - only heating directly where the food is, instead of a whole stovetop, as is common. \n\nSolar with DC supply, it makes sense to put the powerwall in the kitchen, adjacent to where the power is used. Kitchens are already often flame or fire resistant with safety fire alarms and extinguishing equipment. This allows DC from the powerwall to feed cooking equipment with a minimum of wire runs.\n\nAll these things probably enable more affordable and rapid electric vehicle adoption."

The thing that is obviously the main problem isn't real, woah I'm so anti elite while actually being elite, please get mad at me!\" \n\nMeanwhile, the democrats under Biden, have been improving record amounts of fossil fuel permits and Oil companies have legitimately never been richer. They are in rampant dividend mode and they will say it themselves as well. \n\nThe majority of our bodies of power are working against us, at the benefit of the fossil fuel companies, to the detriment of billions of humans and trillions of species. If somebody was watching from above everything that was happening to our planet, they it woudl seem insanely ironic and pitiful. Not trying to bash the individual, because I know how powerless we can seem to be, but we gotta try harder. I'll try just a little bit harder, and you and we motivate our families and neighbors to think about it. Just something. \n\nIt's been the dominant focus of our media and thought process for decades now. All these movies depicting the end of civilization. There's the ones with climate collapse, authoritarian regimes taking power and aliens subjugating us(don't see a difference between the last two) But, pick your poison I guess. Cause one of these will be happening. Maybe a combination of them. \n\nHowever with all of these there is really only one solution, the people need to unite and try to better their own lives as well as the others around you. Break free from the societal expectations placed on us by the people in power. Take back our ability to have an effect on the world around us and to choose our own laws to dictate us. Then maybe we wouldn't be in a known about apocalypse scenario with the people causing it choosing how we fix it. Food for thought. Be safe."

I don\u2019t remember hearing him say anything about it last night before things went off the rails.\nDoug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, as far as I\u2019m aware didn\u2019t get a chance to say anything on the topic last night, has very openly acknowledged climate change in the past, and in 2021 announced North Dakota\u2019s plans of carbon neutrality by 2030.  He has shown to have much more concern about the climate crisis than other republicans.\n\nFor the other candidates who don\u2019t believe in climate change: Vivek Ramaswany openly declared climate change a hoax (and was pretty heavily boo\u2019d for it, surprisingly), and Ron Densantis pretty clearly eluded to the fact he doesn\u2019t believe in it.  Mike Pence dodged the question as best he could, which is technically an improvement over 2016 when he was openly denying it?  He seemed still very skeptical but didn\u2019t want to receive any backlash I guess.\n\nSo of the eight candidates on stage - 5 acknowledged the existence of climate change either tonight or the ones who didn\u2019t get a chance to speak did so in the recent past, 2 were pretty obvious climate deniers, and Pence was pretty dodgy.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that only Christ Christie and Doug Burgum support government action on climate change, while the rest just acknowledged it existed with no plans of government intervention. \n\nI watched the debate live on Hulu, so odds are if you want to watch a recording it\u2019s available there.  NY times has a little snippet on all the GOP stances on climate change here: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/18/us/politics/republican-candidates-2024-climate.html\n\nI\u2019m all for directing people towards climate friendly voting, but misleading information is not the way to go about that."

He HAS the leverage. There is nothing Petro can do about that. Mordisco effectively has the forest as a hostage.

The Maui fires are especially telling: the electric system lacked the capacity to shut off during a period of extreme wild fire risk, and in the wake of the fire, Hawaiian hospitals were overwhelmed with too many injured for the number of beds they have, to the point that injured people had to be transported off the island for treatment.

Previously, the Commons was smaller, like a field, a mountain, a lake or even a forest. But now, with the climate it\u2019s absolutely everything. Even calling it climate change is a political appeasement and a massive understatement of the severity of the situation. \n\nYes, the rich have had an outsized impact and deserve most of the blame. But let\u2019s be clear - it\u2019s all relative. Consumers in developed countries ARE the rich and have a greater responsibility. The Tragedy of the Commons happens precisely because people point fingers when the bad things happen. We must short circuit that thought, because citizens of the developed world are voters, and we have the power to change our trajectory. \n\nI\u2019m done with nihilism. If it\u2019s true that there\u2019s nothing I can do, so be it. But we are at an inflection point in the history of humanity, and I\u2019m sure as shit not going to sit on the sidelines knocking back beers while other people bust their asses trying."

The natural wonders of our world melting before our eyes? This kind of empathy is admirable, but the scale of these forces is beyond any single person or solution, so why torture yourself? Rubbing your nose in everyone else's shit will only make you sick.\n\nIn reality these tumultuous times are dwarfed by the chaos that occurred before humans ever existed and, as always, the solution is evolution.

The decision - whether we take the latter road of collapse or save ourselves at the eleventh hour from our own self-mutilation - lies only with ourselves or with politicians and men of science who take upon themselves a truly appalling responsibility.

Then, in April, that historic snowpack started to melt, and the runoff pooled in the valley\u2019s basin. Tulare Lake, which was drained and planted more than a century ago by powerful agricultural interests, began to reappear. Residents of the valley\u2019s small cities and towns scrambled to protect themselves, piling sandbags around their houses and building makeshift berms around their communities. Today, Tulare Lake is almost the size of Lake Tahoe, and it could take years for the waters to subside.\n\nCheck out the link above."

The main goal is to gain votes by opposing all restrictive measures tackling climate change.**  \nCould the Rassemblement National (RN) turn one of its weaknesses, the environmental issue, into an electoral asset? The far-right party certainly thinks so. It sees environmentalism and the inevitable adaptation measures to global warming as a major divide for the years ahead and a divisive national theme to exploit, as it has successfully accomplished with immigration.  \nAs one party official involved in the discussions put it, by refining its environmental doctrine, the RN is trying to \"reawaken the divide\" between urban dwellers and the rural and semi-urban world that makes up the bulk of its voter base. Until now, \"localism,\" a concept inspired by the far-right identitarian movement and based on the dogma of borders, had been the RN's almost sole talking point. But the term is likely to take a back seat behind \"common-sense ecology,\" which the party will oppose to what it calls \"punitive ecology.\" \"The ideology \\[of environmentalists\\] is the fight against humans,\" Marine Le Pen argued on May 1, claiming to represent a \"much more effective ecology that respects the balance between human activity and nature.\"  \nIn other words, the RN intends to oppose anything threatening to disrupt the lifestyles and consumption patterns of French people and that is decided \u2013 be it in Paris or Brussels \u2013 in the name of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. The populist agrarian BBB party (Farmer-Citizen Movement) was able to use this model to come out on top in the Dutch elections last November. Likewise, in Spain, the far-right Vox party is vying for the agriculture portfolio in regional governments.  \n\n\nThis new reading is based on two key ideas: Resurrecting agrarianism by contrasting two simplistic visions of rurality and city dwellers, and adopting a techno-solutionist stance on global warming by arguing that the problem will be solved through research. The party's updated project is to mention France's carbon trajectories and how the RN intends to comply with them, though a final position on the subject has yet to be decided.  \nLastly, the party is determined to ban all public comments questioning the reality of global warming and its anthropogenic origins, to ensure its credibility in this field. But it still frequently minimizes the scope of climate change: \"The IPCC \\[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\] has always been very, very alarmist,\" said Le Pen on May 1. \"When you have your nose in this climate concern, you tend to be slightly more pessimistic.\"  \n\n\n**Read the full article here:** [**https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/08/24/the-new-political-divide-france-s-far-right-wants-to-exploit-environmentalism\\_6105898\\_114.html**](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/08/24/the-new-political-divide-france-s-far-right-wants-to-exploit-environmentalism_6105898_114.html)"

The spurt of emissions wasn\u2019t unprecedented; extremes of both hot and cold have wreaked havoc in the Permian Basin in the past.\n\nBut this time there was a new witness. As it happens, a new telescope orbiting the Earth captured an unprecedented picture of the climate damage. Known as EMIT, the sensor rides on the underbelly of the International Space Station, which zoomed past the field in West Texas and New Mexico on five different days of the heat wave and documented huge clouds of escaping methane gas. The observations, described here for the first time, show how advances in technology are ushering in a new era of accountability."

The park is at the center of a small zone where amphibian, bird, mammal, and vascular plant diversity all reach their maximum levels within the western hemisphere. Moreover, the park breaks world records for local-scale (less than 100 km2) tree, amphibian, and bat species richness, and is one of the richest spots in the world for birds and mammals at local scales as well. The park also harbors a lot of amphibian diversity compared to other sites sampled in the western Amazon. Reptile species in the park are also very high in diversity with 121 documented species found. In spite of covering less than 0.15% of the Amazon Basin, Yasuni is home to approximately one-third of amphibian and reptile species. The park also harbors high levels of fish diversity with 382 known species. Yasuni is also home to at least 596 bird species which comprises one-third of the total native bird species for the Amazon. The park is also rich in species of bats. On a regional scale, the Amazon Basin has an estimated 117 bat species, but on a local scale, Yasuni is estimated to have comparable richness. In a single hectare, Yasuni has over 100,000 different species of insects which is roughly the amount of insect species that can be found in all of North America. The park also boasts one of the world's richest levels of vascular plants. It is one of nine places in the world that has over 4,000 vascular plant species per 10,000 km2. The park contains many species of trees and shrubs and holds at least four world records for documented tree and liana richness as well as three world records for diversity in woody plant species. The park also hosts a list endemic species such as 43 different species of vertebrates and 220\u2013720 different plant species. Moreover, the park breaks world records for local-scale (less than 100 km2) tree, amphibian, and bat species richness, and is one of the richest spots in the world for birds and mammals at local scales as well."

As it happens, a new telescope orbiting the Earth captured an unprecedented picture of the climate damage. Known as EMIT, the sensor rides on the underbelly of International Space Station, which zoomed past the field in West Texas and New Mexico on five different days of the heat wave and documented huge clouds of escaping methane gas. The observations, described here for the first time, show how advances in technology are ushering in a new era of accountability.\n\n....\n\n>Scientists at the nonprofit Carbon Mapper studied the EMIT data and identified 22 methane plumes during the late June heat wave. The group estimates that together they were gushing at a rate of more than 79 metric tons an hour. That\u2019s about the same short-term global warming impact as 2.8 million idling cars.\n\n...\n\n>The company responsible for the most emissions caught by EMIT\u2019s June flyover was pipeline operator Targa Resources Corp., according to a Bloomberg analysis of the Carbon Mapper data. Targa, which is among the largest gatherers and processors of natural gas in the Permian, was likely responsible for a total of eight of the 22 methane plumes, emitting a combined 46 tons of methane an hour.\n\n....\n\n>Bloomberg\u2019s analysis showed five of the plumes likely came from assets owned by West Texas Gas Inc., a closely held pipeline operator based in Midland. Another four were linked to Earthstone Energy Inc., an oil and gas producer in The Woodlands.\n\n.....\n\n>The satellite observations reveal only a sliver of all the methane that was released in the basin during this summer\u2019s Texas heat wave. The space station passed by for a few seconds on each of the five days it visited, scanning just a small section of the field each time. Its sensor can detect only the very largest events.\n\narticle continues...."

As someone who currently works in the environmental industry (environmental consulting) take articles like these with a grain of salt. Yes, the industry is growing, but no where close to the rate at new graduates are being produced.\n\nOver the past decade, I\u2019d say the industry has grown by about 40%. However, the number of graduates in environmental science has quadrupled. It\u2019s more difficult than ever to find an entry-level environmental position. For example, my firm hired two entry-level consultants in the spring. In a two week span, we had 200 applicants for the position. Some really good candidates were rejected, just because of the numbers game.\n\nWhere the industry needs the most help is the mid-career professional; those who can step right in and run projects. The \u201cboomers\u201d already got a foot out the door for retirement, and there\u2019s a large gap with those who can replace them. If you\u2019re an environmental professional with 8 - 15 years of experience & some certifications (PE, PG, CIH) firms are climbing over each other to hire you. And if you aren\u2019t an \u201cenvironmental\u201d professional, there\u2019s still opportunities in back office positions (think accounting, finance, marketing, HR) at environmental firms that need to be filled.\n\nI bring this up because it\u2019s great to see a lot of interest in \u201cgreen\u201d careers, but temper it with some reality. Check the sister sub at [r/environmental_careers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Environmental_Careers) to see some of the difficulties people encounter. Still, there are opportunities in the field for growth and we need professionals more than ever to help solve an increasing amount of environmental issues."

Every storm brings us a story of someone who is rebuilding their home for the third, fifth, eighth time.  And what's worse, is that insurance companies KNOW that these houses are doomed, and won't insure them, so the federal government (us) picks up the tab.\n\nWe need to change the laws, to make insurance in any disaster prone area ONE TIME insurance.  You get the money to rebuild ONCE.  And you get it right away.  You can choose to take that money, leave, give your land up.  Or you can choose to rebuild, but NEVER ask for another dime again.  \n\nHe talks about a barricade that has been rebuilt EIGHT times.  We should never have done that.  After a few, we should have realized the spot is a lost cause, pulled back, worked with nature to work with whatever the new shoreline was.  Imagine what we could have done with the money for those 8 rebuilds?  \n\nMore than 21 properties with national flood insurance have been rebuilt TEN times or more!!  That's federal insurance, so we are all paying for that, rather than paying to move those people somewhere else, or paying for green energy, or other actual USEFUL things to do in the face of climate change.\n\nThese are hard choices, but we cannot build, rebuild, rebuild, over and over, we need to focus that money and those resources building where it makes sense, and building those places to last."

About two-thirds of the canal's traffic is either headed for \u2014 or leaving \u2014 the United States.\n\nThe canal, a linchpin connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, is renowned for its ability to save time and billions of dollars by offering ships a shortcut around the tip of South America. But the Panama Canal passes through lakes whose levels are now \"close to the minimum,\" said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the canal.\n\nThe region home to the canal has had an unprecedented dry season, leading to a significant decline in water levels within the canal, which relies on fresh water to operate. As a result, the canal's daily operations have been disrupted, with the number of vessels passing through each day reduced from 36 to 32. That has caused delays and traffic congestion at sea.  \n\n**Read more:** https://www.cbsnews.com/news/panama-canal-drought-threatens-global-cargo-ship-traffic/"

Local residents are up in arms against the project, which they believe will negatively impact tourism.**  \nIn the peaceful bay of Poros, a small island in the Saronic Gulf an hour and a half from Athens, the director of the NGO Katheti, Fay Orfanidou, is not lulled by the heat. For months, she has been campaigning against a project from the Greek government to transform her island into a strategic zone for the development of fish farming.  \nA quarter of the island's coastline could soon be invaded by fish-farming ponds in coves whose turquoise-green waters had until now remained unspoiled. Poros already has four such ponds, created in the 1990s in the north of the island. But the new project, spearheaded by Avramar, plans to increase sea bream and sea bass production eightfold to 8,831 tonnes in only five years.  \n\"What's the point of conducting intensive farming on an island that relies over 90% on tourism and attracts visitors thanks to the quality of its waters?\" said Orfanidou, who launched an online petition. According to the activist, the environmental study commissioned by Avramar \u2013 the European leader in sea bass and sea bream production, whose shareholders are US (Amerra Capital Management) and Emirati (Mubadala) investment funds \u2013 indicated that the waste produced by the aquaculture activity will be equivalent to that of a town of 35,000 people. Poros has just 3,500 residents.  \nSince 2011, Greece has identified 25 strategic sites for developing fish farming activities. The country is already Europe's leading producer of farmed sea bass and sea bream, with 83% of Greek production destined for export, including to Italy, Spain and France. The industry hires few locals. In Poros, fewer than 10 people are employed in aquaculture. While the development of these 25 sites seemed to have slowed down during the economic crisis, the European Union allocated \u20ac92 million to the country to develop the activity between 2023 and 2027. Fish farming is seen as an alternative to overfishing and a \"low-carbon\" activity. Fish farms have recently been built in eight of the 25 locations featured in the plan, including Xiromero, in the Aetolia-Acarnania region of western Greece. Despite opposition from the municipality and local residents, the project was launched in a key biodiversity area.   \n**Read the full article here:** [**https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2023/08/22/the-greek-island-of-poros-fierce-opposition-to-the-uncontrolled-growth-of-fish-farming\\_6103918\\_19.html**](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/economy/article/2023/08/22/the-greek-island-of-poros-fierce-opposition-to-the-uncontrolled-growth-of-fish-farming_6103918_19.html)"

                    "text": "We Are Witnessing the First Stages of Civilization\u2019s Collapse\n\nWill our own elites perform any better than the rulers of Chaco Canyon, the Mayan heartland, and Viking Greenland?\n\nShare\n\n\ufffcFlames from the Caldor Fire crown in trees at Echo Lake, Calif., in August 2021. (Carlos Avila Gonzalez / San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n\nThis article originally appeared at\u00a0TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from\u00a0TomDispatch.com.\n\nIn his 2005 bestseller\u00a0Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, geographer Jared Diamond focused on past civilizations that confronted severe climate shocks, either adapting and surviving or failing to adapt and disintegrating. Among those were the Puebloan culture of Chaco Canyon, N.M., the ancient Mayan civilization of Mesoamerica, and the Viking settlers of Greenland. Such societies, having achieved great success, imploded when their governing elites failed to adopt new survival mechanisms to face radically changing climate conditions.\n\nBear in mind that, for their time and place, the societies Diamond studied supported large, sophisticated populations. Pueblo Bonito, a six-story structure in Chaco Canyon, contained up to 600 rooms, making it the largest building in North America until the first skyscrapers rose in New York some 800 years later. Mayan civilization is believed to have supported a population of more than 10 million people at its peak between 250 and 900 A.D., while the Norse Greenlanders established a distinctively European society around 1000 A.D. in the middle of a frozen wasteland. Still, in the end, each collapsed utterly and their inhabitants either died of starvation, slaughtered each other, or migrated elsewhere, leaving nothing but ruins behind.\n\nThe question today is: Will our own elites perform any better than the rulers of Chaco Canyon, the Mayan heartland, and Viking Greenland?\n\nAs Diamond argues, each of those civilizations arose in a period of relatively benign climate conditions, when temperatures were moderate and food and water supplies adequate. In each case, however, the climate shifted wrenchingly, bringing persistent drought or, in Greenland\u2019s case, much colder temperatures. Although no contemporary written records remain to tell us how the ruling elites responded, the archaeological evidence suggests that they persisted in their traditional ways until disintegration became unavoidable.\n\nThese historical examples of social disintegration spurred lively discussion among my students when, as a professor at Hampshire College, I regularly assigned\u00a0Collapse\u00a0as a required text. Even then, a decade ago, many of them suggested that we were beginning to face severe climate challenges akin to those encountered by earlier societies\u2014and that our contemporary civilization also risked collapse if we failed to take adequate measures to slow global warming and adapt to its inescapable consequences.\n\nBut in those discussions (which continued until I retired from teaching in 2018), our analyses seemed entirely theoretical: Yes, contemporary civilization might collapse, but if so, not any time soon. Five years later, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to support such a relatively optimistic outlook. Not only does the collapse of modern industrial civilization appear ever more likely, but the process already seems underway.\n\nWhen do we know that a civilization is on the verge of collapse? In his now almost 20-year-old classic, Diamond identified three key indicators or precursors of imminent dissolution: a persistent pattern of environmental change for the worse like long-lasting droughts; signs that existing modes of agriculture or industrial production were aggravating the crisis; and an elite failure to abandon harmful practices and adopt new means of production. At some point, a critical threshold is crossed and collapse invariably follows."

We've heard enough stories about how evil these people can be to know they don't do the right thing. \nFrankly, if you aren't frightened by this summer's climate catastrophes, I don't know how to get you. But elites are doing what they always do, draining the world so as to hoard money for them and their families. Consumerism is changing dramatically. It will come to resource wars, terrible working and living conditions. Animals will die off, and humans will learn that all that separated us from them was an illusion. Immigration policies will become more cruel, look at Abbott's draconian brutality, along with certain European countries. \nI think people will fight back but protesting by sitting in the street won't do it (I respect the protesters, but just being realistic)."

It's a fraction of what nuclear weapons testing introduced, which in turn is less than ten thousandth of natural activity in the ocean.\n\nCan we please talk about real environmental problems instead of radiophobia scares?"

This level is 180 times higher than the national standard set by the Food Sanitation Act, which is 100 becquerels per kilogram. They stated that measures are being taken, such as installing multiple nets to prevent fish from leaving the harbor area.\n\nThe croaker measured 30.5 centimeters in length and weighed 384 grams. It was caught in an area surrounded by breakwaters on the seaward side of Units 1 to 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, where relatively high concentrations of radioactive substances are flowing in with the drainage. In April of this year, a sea bass caught in the same area was found to contain 1,200 becquerels of cesium. (Kyodo News)"

And it\u2019s only going to get worse, as the sea level along the Washington coast is likely to rise between 2 feet and 3 feet by the end of the century, according to the Washington Costal Resilience Project, funded primarily by a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this type of flooding in my lifetime,\u201d said Lia Frenchman, whose street has flooded twice in the past few years. \u201cSo when it does flood, unfortunately, my end of the street has a large dip in the road and the water will stay for up to a week at a time. And so I\u2019m basically either trapped or not able to come home.\u201d\n\nNow the Quinault Nation has a plan to relocate the entire town of Taholah, where Frenchman lives, to an area a mile uphill on tribal land. A smaller town north of Taholah, called Queets, is planning to relocate as well.\n\nQuinault is one of three Native American communities to receive a $25 million grant from the U.S. Department of the Interior for climate-related relocation efforts.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really ever done this before as a country, relocating entire communities in response to climate change. And so we\u2019ve got a lot to learn ourselves about how to coordinate this work across a number of federal agencies,\u201d said Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland at the Department of the Interior.\n\nFull video here: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/what-it-takes-to-relocate-a-town-facing-sea-level-rise.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/what-it-takes-to-relocate-a-town-facing-sea-level-rise.html)"

Yes, unleaded gas will work in them, but it runs the risk of damaging the engines.\n\nJust an FYI to add some context.\n\nEdit: OP posted below that there recently was a leaded fuel alternative that was approved for older planes that took leaded fuel.

That day, Sengier\u2019s Black employees organized a massive mining strike across Katanga. In Elisabethville, 500 workers refused to start their shifts. Soon, freshly off-duty miners joined them and assembled in front of management\u2019s offices, demanding a raise. They won an agreement that they could come bargain the next day.\n\n> The next morning, the mine workers showed up to the local soccer stadium to negotiate with Sengier\u2019s company and the colonial governor of Katanga. According to conflicting reports, between 800 and 2,000 strikers attended. The company offered a verbal agreement to raise wages. One historian describes it as the \u201cfirst open expression of open protest in the social history of the Congo.\u201d But when a Congolese worker named L\u00e9onard Mpoyi demanded written confirmation of the wage raise, the colonial governor insisted the crowd go home.\n\n> \u201cI refuse,\u201d Mpoyi said. \u201cYou must give us some proof that the company has agreed to raise our salaries.\u201d\n\n> \u201cI have already demanded that you go to the office to check,\u201d replied the governor, Amour Marron. He then pulled a gun from his pocket and shot Mpoyi, point blank. Soldiers opened fire \u201cfrom all directions.\u201d The mine workers poured out of the stadium. Roughly 70 people died. About 100 were injured.\n\n> The next morning, a company loudspeaker summoned everyone back to work.\n\nSome people think this kind of thing can't happen in the U.S.A.? It already has, as early as 1850 in Manhattan, NYC. Some people think this kind of thing can't happen nowadays? If Republicans are allowed to continue dictating government policies by hook or by crook, it *will* happen again, whether by corporate thugs, police, or some modern American version of the brownshirts/Gestapo."

                    "text": "Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket tests in Texas emit methane\n\nAugust 21, 2023 at 10:14 AM EDT\n\n\ufffc\n\nA Blue Origin New Shepard rocket launches from Launch Site One in West Texas north of Van Horn on March 31, 2022.\n\nPatrick T. FALLON\u2014AFP\n\nMethane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is thought to be responsible for\u00a0more than a quarter\u00a0of global warming experienced to date. Controlling it is such an\u00a0urgent priority\u00a0that President Joe Biden recently hosted a \u201cMethane Summit\u201d at the White House.\n\nMost of the problem stems from just a few kinds of places:\u00a0natural gas wells\u00a0and pipelines, cattle feedlots, coal mines, rice paddies, and landfills. But occasionally, the scientists who hunt for large methane releases find them in surprising spots. Such was the case on June 4, when\u00a0a plume of the gas\u00a0was detected at the sprawling ranch in West Texas where billionaire Jeff Bezos tests space rockets.\n\nIt turns out that\u00a0Bezos\u2019s space company, Blue Origin LLC,\u00a0routinely emits the stuff because it\u2019s developing a rocket that runs on liquefied natural gas, which is almost pure methane. The June release was detected by an instrument on board the International Space Station, which happened to be zooming past that day. The nonprofit group Carbon Mapper analyzed the readings and estimated the gas was escaping at about 1.5 metric tons per hour. There\u2019s no indication of how long it\u00a0lasted.\n\n\u201cWe frequently transfer LNG from our suppliers into storage tanks at our engine test stands. Everything operated normally,\u201d said Sara Blask, a spokeswoman for Blue Origin, in an email. \u201cThere were no issues or reporting thresholds exceeded.\u201d She declined to comment on how much gas was released. The state air regulator, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, doesn\u2019t impose limits on methane emissions or require disclosure of releases.\n\nAn\u00a0air permit application\u00a0filed with the TCEQ in January 2020 said the company expected to routinely dump LNG into the air to the tune of 3.4 million cubic feet a year, which would work out to more than 60 tons of methane. It\u2019s unclear from state documents if those numbers reflect current operations, and Blask declined to clarify. She also didn\u2019t comment on why the test site\u2019s flare was not used to burn the gas, a step that would greatly reduce the climate impact.\n\nOf course, Blue Origin\u2019s emissions pale in comparison with those from its suppliers in the natural gas industry. Wells and pipelines in the Permian Basin, a huge oilfield near the rocket site, are thought to give off\u00a0some 2.7 million tons of methane a year. And\u00a0Blue Origin is not unique\u00a0in developing methane-powered rocket engines; so are rivals including\u00a0SpaceX.\n\nMethane is just a small part of the space industry\u2019s overall impact on the climate \u2014 and that impact is\u00a0not well understood. Exhaust particles emitted high above the earth can have an \u201cumbrella\u201d effect, preventing sunlight from reaching the ground, said Martin Ross, an atmospheric scientist at the nonprofit Aerospace Corp. Because of uncertainty around that and other aspects of space flight, scientists aren\u2019t sure whether the industry causes net heating or cooling in the lower atmosphere, he said.\u00a0\n\nThe question may get more attention in the coming years. Estimated to be worth $447 billion, the space industry could reach $1 trillion by 2030, according to\u00a0estimates from McKinsey\u00a0and the World Economic Forum. \u201cThe amount of emissions right now isn\u2019t that great to be a significant contributor to the total of human impact on climate,\u201d Ross said, but \u201cwe think there is going to be a lot of growth.\u201d\n\nIronically, one of the growth drivers for the commercial space sector is launching satellites for environmental monitoring of pollutants, including methane.\u00a0\n\nBezos has argued that humans must colonize space because the Earth\u2019s resources are finite. In\u00a0a 2019 speech\u00a0at Blue Origin, he envisioned a future in which dirty industrial activity took place off-world and that our home was \u201czoned for residential and light industry.\u201d As he\u00a0tweeted\u00a0in 2018, \u201cWe go to space to save the Earth.\u201d\n\nThe days of permanent space colonies are still a ways off. In the meantime, many of Blue Origin\u2019s flights have ferried wealthy tourists on brief jaunts into space, including, in 2021, Bezos himself.\u00a0\n\nSubscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.\u00a0Sign up today."

Researchers exposed mice to wood smoke over a 2-week period and then examined their brains at multiple timepoints up to 28 days later.\n\n* Smoke caused an increase in proinflammatory endothelial cells in the brain's blood vessels that peaked 1-3 days after exposure but persisted for 14 days.\n* After the smoke exposure ended, there was a delayed activation of the brain's microglia that lasted through at least 28 days post-exposure.\n* Inflammation-related metabolites in the hippocampus region of the brain showed fluctuations over the 28-day period, ending with decreased levels of the protective molecule NAD+.\n* Peripheral immune cells like neutrophils infiltrated the brain around day 14 but a small inflammatory neutrophil population remained at day 28.\n\nOverall, this demonstrates that even limited exposure to wildfire smoke triggers neuroinflammation that continues changing dynamically for weeks after the exposure ends. This may help explain long-term neurological impacts seen in human populations exposed to smoke from large wildfires."

He went on to warn that environmental disasters will become more common due to global warming. \n\n\u201cWe have to get used to them because they will become more frequent,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe have to adapt and make substantive changes to the way we understand our territory.\u201d\n\nRains have forced the evacuation of more than 33,000 people and damaged more than 800 homes, according to data from the government.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon has led to a increase in rainfall in Chile this year compared to previous years. However, rains in central Chile are still about 20% lower than average. Warmer temperatures at the southern hemisphere winter have led to more rainfall at higher altitudes, melting snowpack and leading to the floods.\n\nRains caused the destruction of a bridge in the region of Maule."

Syria was one of the first climate conflicts) made the right wing parties soar which in turn threatens the livability of those places.

Still, it would take a unique combination of the elements to produce America\u2019s deadliest wildfire in more than a century. In the days before the wildfire started on August 8, temperatures in Lahaina simmered in the high 80s Fahrenheit \u2014 about average for the time of year. But it was drier than usual. Amid this arid backdrop came the wind. Over August 7 to 9, gale-force wind gusts reached 67 miles per hour in Maui County. However, warmer temperatures weren\u2019t the driving factor in Maui, which saw only 'a small background signal of climate change,' said the climatologist Abby Frazier at Clark University in Massachusetts. Instead, invasive grasses were 'the largest factor at play with this fire.\u2019    \nWhen American missionaries arrived in Lahaina in the early 19th century, they transformed the tropical region by building over wetlands and Hawaiian fishponds and turning the port into an international hub for whale oil. By the mid-1800s, sugarcane became a key Lahaina export. The town\u2019s first sugar company, Pioneer Mill, developed the dry forest and native shrubland around Lahaina into plantations. By the 1930s sugar plantations covered more than 100,000 hectares of Hawaii. Cheaper labor markets in India, South America and the Caribbean in the following decades led most Hawaiian sugar companies to end production by the 1990s and the plantation lands were largely abandoned. But the lush forest and native shrubland did not return. African grasses took over which had been introduced to the islands as pasture for livestock.    \nThe grassland expansion over the last century has coincided with a roughly 400% increase in wildfires, according to the Pacific Fire Exchange group. Investigators have yet to determine what first sparked the Lahaina fire, but scientists say it is clear how flames managed to rush so quickly."

Kelowna and the Westbank First Nation declared states of emergency as the fires spanned hundreds of hectares. SHAWN TALBOT/THE GLOBE AND MAIL\n\nA red sun over Montreal. Crops withering in the field. Thousands of people fleeing a territorial capital. Smoke blanketing cities from Toronto to Ottawa to New York.\n\nThese are not scenes out of a dystopian novel but pulled straight from Canada\u2019s summer of fire and smoke, now cresting in the frightening\u00a0evacuations of Yellowknife\u00a0and Kelowna.\n\nSevere wildfires from Nova Scotia to British Columbia have cast a literal pall over the country \u2013 just as they have wreaked havoc around the world, from Maui to Greece to China \u2013 both as an everyday irritant and health scare, and as a dark manifestation of global warming. The more than 20,000 residents of the Northwest Territories who have been\u00a0ordered to leave their homes, often along highways turned into corridors of flame, comes as the latest and most extreme reminder that the effects of a heating planet are literally at our doors.\n\nDevon Allie, a 24-year-old software engineer living in Montreal, said the thick veil of smoke that descended on the city in June made him think of a volcanic eruption.\n\n\u201cFor so long we\u2019ve heard about climate change but you\u2019ve never felt the impact so clearly and starkly,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see the whole city covered in smoke, which never happens, it\u2019s a real show-stopper. Especially when the sun turns red. You can\u2019t get more apocalyptic than that.\u201d\n\nOn the front lines, firefighters have tried to beat the blazes back and at least four of them have lost their lives. But the situation has also affected countless Canadians in other ways, both materially and psychologically, as people across the country report a sense of dread about the disaster unfolding just out of sight, and what it portends for the future.\n\nYellowknife resident Maggie Works has been grappling with that additional fear as she flees from the encroaching fire. She didn\u2019t wait for an official evacuation order to pack her \u201cgo bags\u201d \u2013 a new phrase in the lexicons of many Canadians \u2013 and by Wednesday at noon, she and her partner were on the road, passing through the remains of Enterprise, a remote hamlet of about 100 that was decimated by a wildfire on the weekend.\n\n\u201cWith the reality of\u00a0climate change, I am worried that these wildfires are just going to get even more wild,\u201d she said. \u201cClimate change has affected the whole world this summer with the wildfires destroying parts of Hawaii, flash floods in Halifax. It\u2019s just craziness all over. I hope that the federal government realizes this and takes action before it gets even worse.\u201d\n\nC"
